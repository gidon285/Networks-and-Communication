# C - Client Server Implementation

Implements a simple client server. In this project we have two main files:
- **sender.c** - acts as the client
- **measure.c** - acts as the server

The client receives a 1MB txt file from the `input` folder and sends it 5 times in cubic CC algorithms and then changes the algorithm to reno and sends again.

While running we print each and every output according to the running state and check for errors.
